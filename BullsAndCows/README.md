### Bulls And Cows
Hello everyone!
This is the game bulls and cows and we will give a summary of the game and their functions.
The objective of the game is to guess an aleatory number, you can play it only vs the machine, machine vs player, and player vs player 
- Player Vs Machine:
In the player vs machine you have to guess a number, the game gives you some clues named bulls and cows, the bulls are the number in the correct positions and the cows are the correct numbers but they aren't in the correct position, the game have some helps and only works if you want to have helps and you can choose if you want to play with repeated number or not  
- Machine Vs Player
Honestly we didn't know how to made this gamemode so we only have the machine generating randoms numbers and if for some divine reason it works, marked the machine wins and no more, we tried some ideas but they didn't work so we prefer to do not add them
- Player Vs Player
It has the same logic of player Vs Machine but the difference is in this gamemode you will play for a high score.
For each player the machine generates different random numbers and you need to win more points than your opponent, but this part have a little problem, although the helps are only given if you choose them and in certain points of the game score, if one player choose play with helps and the another not have a little advantage so sorry for that, and is equal if one player choose repeated numbers and the other not

If anyone finds any other bug or wants to help us fix for example the machine vs player it would really helps us a lot
We wait you enjoy the game and help us if you want
